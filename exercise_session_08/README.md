# Solutions Exercise 8 Arsenije Koljancic

## Exercise 1
- No it has different run time
- I inserted the #pragma acc routine seq for the gettime function
- I'm not sure about the job script

## Exercise 2
- I ran the code with ./cpi_cuda not creating a job script
- Looks like openacc is faster but happens sometimes to be slower than cuda. I didnt run cuda that much though# Solutions Exercise 8 Arsenije Koljancic
