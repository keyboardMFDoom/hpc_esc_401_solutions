# Exercise sheet 9 Solutions Arsenije Koljancic
## Exercise 1
- Different sizes of N:

- Execution time GPU vs CPU:
	Execution time of openmp is much faster than of openACC by the order of nearly 10^6. By increasing the size of 		the problem, the execution times increase as well. Maybe it's because the GPU takes longer for memory transfer 
	or such a simple task is not suited for GPUs. 

## Exercise 2
- Problem with the approach:

- Difference between blur_twice_gpu_naive vs blur_twice_gpu_nocopies:

- Execution time:

## Exercise 3
- Reason for race conditions:

- The keyword:

- Difference in performance between GPU and CPU:
